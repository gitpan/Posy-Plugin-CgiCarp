==== NAME ====

Posy::Plugin::CgiCarp - Posy plugin to aid debugging by using CGI::Carp.


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.60'' of Posy::Plugin::CgiCarp.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This plugin is for developers to aid debugging by making all fatal errors
and warning messages be displayed in the browser by using the CGI::Carp
module.


==   Activation   ==

This plugin needs to be added to the plugins list.

This replaces the 'debug' and 'print_header' methods; note that if a plugin
needs to print a header (such as, if, for example, it replaces the
'render_page' method) then it should call the 'print_header' method.


==== REQUIRES ====

    CGI::Carp
    Posy::Core
    Posy
